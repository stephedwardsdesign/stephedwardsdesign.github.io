	<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
	<h5>Hello! I’m Steph, a graphic designer, Photographer and Illustrator from Sydney, Australia</h5>
	<br>
	<p>I am forever being amazed by the possibilities of design and one of my greatest joys is being able to see a person’s idea or vision transform into reality. Design really has the power to change the world.</p>
	<br>
	<p>When I’m not busy working you’ll find me taking photos of this amazing world we live in and planning my next adventure. I am a lover of bad puns and bingeing good TV shows, and I have been known to converse solely in movie quotes. I am also a lover of design. My true love is print design but dabble in photography, illustration, hand crafted designs and typography. This is a collection of some of my most favourite design projects over the last few years, ranging from commercial to university to self initiated love projects.</p>
	<br>
	<p>My desire is to work in a fast pace environment where I am challenged to grow and develop as a designer within the industry. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me – I look forwards to working with you.</p>
